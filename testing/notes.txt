High level tentative plan probably
-> Team models (Classification model, meaning win or loss)
    -> takes in inputs of team stats, opponent stats, home/away, rest days, conditions, news etc
    -> binary outcome, win or lose (1 or 0)
    -> potential model: **1** randomforestclassifier, gradientboostingclassifier, MLPClassifier
-> Score/stat models (Regression model, numerical)
    -> Takes in same inputs, maybe more
    -> predicts final score, total goals scored, or other team numbers like total shots
    -> potential models: randomforestregressor, gradientboostingregressor, MLPregressor
-> Player models (Regression model)
    -> Predict player performance per game
    -> Each player can have their own model or one shared model trained on all players with "player name" as a feature
-> Combine models
    -> Combine player prediction to add to team model as new team features
    -> Better win/loss accuracy, and team stats
    -> Maybe more complex stuff after
Sci-kit models used and for what purpose

Other libraries:
pandas, numpy for data handling or preprocessing
matplotlib for visualization
json, requests for api fetching

Cur things to do for me
1. finish processing data into samples


Notes:

- “Player name as feature” = one shared model learns how each player performs using player ID encoded as input.
- “Combining models” = take outputs (e.g., predicted team goals) from one model and feed them as inputs to another (stacked models).
- Classifier → predicts categories (win/loss)
- Regressor → predicts numbers (scores/stats)
- Gradient Boosting → trees fix each other’s mistakes
- MLP → neural network, like what I built manually



**1** 
Random forest classifier:
Lots of decision trees, decids like where cut offs are by training
e.g. if greater than 0.5 go down this way to this node, else go other way
and eventually it reaches leafs which classify, this is a cat, this is a dog
u can choose num of trees, more trees better because 100 people voting is better than 10
Each tree picks its own thresholds to minimize impurities
