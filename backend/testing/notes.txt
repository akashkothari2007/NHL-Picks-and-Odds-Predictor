High level tentative plan probably
-> Team models (Classification model, meaning win or loss)
    -> takes in inputs of team stats, opponent stats, home/away, rest days, conditions, news etc
    -> binary outcome, win or lose (1 or 0)
    -> potential model: **1** randomforestclassifier, gradientboostingclassifier, MLPClassifier
-> Score/stat models (Regression model, numerical)
    -> Takes in same inputs, maybe more
    -> predicts final score, total goals scored, or other team numbers like total shots
    -> potential models: randomforestregressor, gradientboostingregressor, MLPregressor
-> Player models (Regression model)
    -> Predict player performance per game
    -> Each player can have their own model or one shared model trained on all players with "player name" as a feature
-> Combine models
    -> Combine player prediction to add to team model as new team features
    -> Better win/loss accuracy, and team stats
    -> Maybe more complex stuff after
Sci-kit models used and for what purpose

Other libraries:
pandas, numpy for data handling or preprocessing
matplotlib for visualization
json, requests for api fetching

Cur things to do for me
1. finish processing data into samples


Notes:

- “Player name as feature” = one shared model learns how each player performs using player ID encoded as input.
- “Combining models” = take outputs (e.g., predicted team goals) from one model and feed them as inputs to another (stacked models).
- Classifier → predicts categories (win/loss)
- Regressor → predicts numbers (scores/stats)
- Gradient Boosting → trees fix each other’s mistakes
- MLP → neural network, like what I built manually



**1** 
Random forest classifier:
Lots of decision trees, decids like where cut offs are by training
e.g. if greater than 0.5 go down this way to this node, else go other way
and eventually it reaches leafs which classify, this is a cat, this is a dog
u can choose num of trees, more trees better because 100 people voting is better than 10
Each tree picks its own thresholds to minimize impurities




CODE:

run nba api to get schedule from each year and compile into a massive schedule full_schedule.csv
getting schedule returns -> date, matchup and game id, here we can remove duplicates
then we plug this to get game logs which calls another api to get boxscore for each game 
gamelogs returns -> city, nickname, team_id, win loss flag, home or away, turnovers, rebounds
                 -> team totals, game/season counts, field goal stats, 3 point stats, free throw stats
                 -> rebounding stats, assists, fouls, steals, turnovers, blocks
                 -> poitns and averages
                 -> calculates offensive efficiency (custom)
                 -> calculates scoring margin (custom)
                 -> season, game date, game id
each gamelog will have two rows, one for home team one for away team and we merge this into one row later
then gamelog is plugged into getgamelogfeatuerset which builds samples for our model to learn from
this will merge home and away rows for each game id into one game and it will add even more stats inclduing
    -> teams offensive efficiency from last game
    -> last win % before the game
    -> days rest
    -> 3 game average margin
    -> 3 game average offensive efficiency
    -> whether home team won (targe 1/0)
    -> teams id
    -> all same for away
    -> PLANNING TO ADD
        -> streaks
        -> backtoback home and away (1/0)
        -> momentum index
        -> opponent defensive trend
        -> home/away scoring split
        -> game importance like maybe closer to end of season worth more
        -> injury/linup sentiment
        -> travel fatigue (timezones)
        -> rating per team
        -> head to head record
        -> news or betting sentiment
